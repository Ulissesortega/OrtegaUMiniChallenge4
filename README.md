I liked how you decalared multiple variables on a single line to condense the code. Good use of do/while loops to cover both input validation and play again. Code ran great and re-prompted me anytime I tried to break it. Smart visual spacing to make the program more readable for the user. String interpolation made the code very readable. Good work dude!
